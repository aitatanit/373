This repository contains the Latex files required to compile
a set of upper-division undergraduate lecture notes on 
Quantum Mechanics. These notes were authored by Prof. 
Richard Fitzpatrick (Department of Physics, University 
of Texas at Austin).

The files will only compile properly when the following
standard Latex packages are installed:

fullpage
epsf
charter
euler
fancyhdr

The document can be compiled by issuing the command

latex Quantum

in the base directory (containing Quantum.tex).

The document will need to be compiled at least three times to
update all of the internal references, and to generate the
table of contents data.
